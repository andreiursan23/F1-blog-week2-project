                <h1>Austrian GP driver ratings: Max Verstappen and Lando Norris star as Lewis Hamilton loses title ground</h1>

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Max Verstappen entered the France-Austria-Austria triple-header having never won consecutive   races in Formula 1. He left it having racked up three on the spin to establish a more-than-useful points lead over Lewis Hamilton after nine of the season's scheduled 23 events. No two races are ever the same in Formula 1, but the two at the Red Bull Ring came pretty close for Max. Indeed, as he mentioned himself on the radio afterwards, runaway race two was arguably even better than runaway win one. Lando Norris almost threw a spanner in the works at the end of Q3 but once Verstappen was again on pole for the start and then cleanly out of Turn One in the lead, he was barely seen again. That's what you call dominance.<br><br>
                
                    A best result of the season for Valtteri Bottas, who for the first time in a long while benefitted from a spot of luck rather than suffered from it. Bottas, just outqualified by Lewis Hamilton, would very likely have finished third without his team-mate's car damage, and possibly even fourth without Lando Norris' penalty, but made the most of that to secure what was surely the maximum result considering his grid position and Red Bull's pace advantage. A welcome result on the weekend Hamilton's Mercedes future was secured, but Bottas needs more rounds like this to earn his own new contract.<br><br>

                    A sensational weekend amid a sensational season for Lando Norris, who has already scored more points in nine races than either of his two previous campaigns in F1. That's also three third-place podium finishes in 2021 too, with this one in Austria probably the most emphatic. With McLaren's already-fast car featuring further revisions, Norris came within a whisker of almost unthinkably taking pole position off the dominant Verstappen and then on Sunday drove very strongly all race to initially stay ahead of the Mercedes' and then split them when Hamilton's pace slowed. The one moment of contention was that lap-four, Turn Four incident with Sergio Perez. The stewards and Perez saw it one way, Lando and McLaren the other, and the five-second sanction imposed did certainly seem to cost Norris second to Bottas, even if another third was still a terrific result.<br><br>
                    
                    Lewis Hamilton came into race day stressing the need for "damage limitation" against Verstappen, he finished it ruing a very different sort of damage - and an eighth championship now looks a steep uphill task this year. Biding his time to overtake Norris, Hamilton was set for second place behind Verstappen in Austria before picking up floor damage from the kerbs - losing more than half a second per lap to rivals behind - and he was a sitting duck to both his team-mate and the McLaren as he slumped to fourth. While there's only six points difference between the position Hamilton was in and where he finished, Verstappen's lead is now more than the equivalent of a race win. And Hamilton has never won a title from this far back.<br><br>

                    Carlos Sainz picked up 11 places from his grid positions across the Austrian double-header in a fortnight that has seen him move right up on team-mate Charles Leclerc in the championship. Both missed Q2 here, with Ferrari determined not to sacrifice more durable tyres for the opening race stint, and Sainz duly played the longest game by running the hards to his lap-48 sole stop. It paid dividends with the Spaniard returning in eighth place and then racing forwards on fresher tyres. After being let through by Leclerc with six to go to try and challenge Ricciardo, he overtook the McLaren for fifth too.<br><br>

                    After outqualifying both Mercedes for the first time this season to give him a great chance of backing up Verstappen in the race, Sergio Perez had a "disaster" of a Sunday - involved in three incidents which led to penalties. The first of those, while adjudged to be Norris' fault, was the most costly for the Mexican as Perez attempted an optimistic move around the outside of the McLaren on the first lap post-Safety Car, forced onto the gravel as a result. That gave him a bit of damage while also dropping him into a midfield train he couldn't get out of, and he was handed two separate five-second penalties of his own after combatively and unfairly pushing Charles Leclerc away at Turns 4 and 6. "I'm really sorry if I affected the race of Charles because that's not the way I do my racing," said Perez.<br><br>

                    When measured against Lando Norris' weekend, Daniel Ricciardo's seventh place certainly looks like a clear underperformance given what the impressive McLaren car was capable of. But at least the gain of five positions in the race pointed more encouragingly to progress for Ricciardo after qualifying 13th for the second weekend in a row. The Aussie was involved in a fairly intense race in the midfield after making up crucial early ground either side of the Ocon-triggered Safety Car. Couldn't quite keep Sainz at bay in the end but seventh was still a good recovery drive. Now the big target is to get more out of the car over a single lap at Silverstone.<br><br>

                    A rather frustrating eighth place in the end for Charles Leclerc. He seemed to have more pace than both Ricciardo and Perez but - illegally blocked by the Red Bull driver when he did get close enough to overtake - just wasn't able to show it. Credit to him, he managed to park his anger and think of the team late in the race as he allowed Carlos Sainz through, helping Ferrari limit the gap to McLaren. The end of a chaotic and incident-packed Austria back-to-back for the Monegasque.<br><br>

                    At least this time it was an Austrian race that lasted for more than one lap and delivered points for Pierre Gasly, but there may have ultimately been a sense of disappointment for the Frenchman given he twice put the AlphaTauri on the third row here. But the team always appeared vulnerable on Sunday by virtue of being locked into starting on the soft tyres and so it proved, with several cars from the middle of the grid jumping ahead via one-stoppers after Pierre's lap-13 stop. Given that, this was yet another very decent drive from Gasly.<br><br>

                    One point gained by Fernando Alonso to extend his top-10 streak to four races - but he could have been a lot higher up the order without his Saturday misfortune. A rapidly improving Alonso was showing top-five pace in qualifying before he was blocked by Sebastian Vettel on his last Q2 lap, which left him down in a disappointing 14th.From there it was always going to be difficult to recover, and he just managed to secure 10th via a late and somewhat heart-breaking overtake on George Russell. Alonso is really starting to dominate Alpine team-mate Esteban Ocon.

                <h1>Lewis Hamilton's contract will not 'be his last': Mercedes on new F1 deal and who could be 2022 team-mate</h1>

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Mercedes boss Toto Wolff has raised the prospect of Lewis Hamilton racing into his 40s by claiming his new contract will not be his last in F1, and says the team are nearing a decision on his 2022 team-mate.<br><br>
                
                    After negotiations described as "very easy" compared to their last, Hamilton committed himself to Mercedes and F1 until the end of the 2023 season last weekend by penning a new two-year contract.<br><br>

                    By the end of his new deal, Hamilton will be nearly 39 years old and he told reporters at the Austrian GP: "I don't plan to be here until I'm 40. I hope I have something else exciting to do beyond." But Wolff has backed the sport's most successful driver to race on, "I'm pretty sure it's not his last contract," he told F1. "I think he always flirts with the thought that this may be the last contract and in a way, it keeps the options open for the last. "But no, it's not going to be his last."<br><br>
                    
                    Hamilton's new contract puts him in sync with his influential team boss Wolff, who is also signed up for two more years. It was announced just five months after the pair agreed a, somewhat last-minute, one-year deal for 2021. "It was very easy," Wolff stated to Sky F1 of the latest talks. "We didn't want to make the mistake that we did last time, when we dragged it on over the whole year simply because we were busy racing. "This time we thought it's a more difficult championship and we want to have stability in the team. Lewis and I were pretty clear early on that this would be continued." Hamilton and Wolff have also voiced their enthusiasm for leading Mercedes into a new era of F1 from next season, as the sport prepares for a major regulations overhaul with much-changed cars and aero rules.<br><br>

                    The future of F1's seven-time world champion has been secured, but Mercedes are still biding their time to confirm who will partner him in 2022. A decision, though, should be made this summer - with it thought to be a head-to-head fight between current occupier of that seat Valtteri Bottas, and rising star George Russell. "We already said we are going to look at the next races and we are right in there," said Wolff. "Valtteri has been informed about every single step [with Hamilton] and we asked him if it was fine if we announced it and he said, 'I don't care'. "It's all good. We want to come to a decision over the summer."<br><br>

                    Bottas has been with Mercedes since 2017 but, while pushing Hamilton, has yet to truly challenge him over a season. Russell, a Mercedes junior driver, has enjoyed a sparkling three years with Williams towards the back of the grid, and impressed when deputising for Hamilton at last year's Sakhir GP. The young British driver believes he's ready for the call-up. "I've said it before, I want to be fighting for victories and world championships," he told Sky F1's Rachel Brookes. "I've worked so hard to get to Formula 1 and I didn't work that hard just to be fighting for P15. I'm here to win and I want to win and that's what I want to do sooner rather than later.<br><br>

                    "How long will I wait for Mercedes? I'm in constant communication with them. They've looked after me and they're in control of my destiny, wherever that may be. They've always said, if you do the job, you'll be rewarded. Simple as that." Russell, whose Williams team are powered by Mercedes engines, then coyly added: "I'll have a Mercedes engine in the back of me next year, no matter what. I'm a Mercedes driver and I'm loyal to Mercedes."

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Formula 1 has described Saturday's meeting between current engine manufacturers as well as bosses from Porsche and Audi as "very positive" and a "step forward". The engine regulations from 2025 were discussed at the meeting, with F1 hopeful of bringing more suppliers into the sport. Representatives from Mercedes, Ferrari and Renault were all in attendance, along with Audi chairman Markus Duesmann and Porsche CEO Oliver Blume. "Very positive discussions took place with all of the current and potential new Power Unit suppliers regarding the next phase of the Formula 1 Power Unit," said F1 in a statement. "The discussions will continue over the coming weeks with further news to be announced following those discussions."  F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali added to Sky Sports F1 in Austria: "I think it was a great meeting because we were discussing something serious and we were discussing something that is related to the future of Formula 1.  "As always before saying something official in terms of the output, I would say we are working in the next days and weeks. At the end of the day, we will present it. But a good step in the right direction."<br><br>
                
                    Lewis Hamilton was rather pessimistic about the F1 2021 title immediately after the Austrian GP - but last night issued a rallying cry on social media, insisting "giving up is never an option" and that he trusts his Mercedes team to "fight back". Posting on his Instagram stories, Hamilton said: "It is times like these that we must stay vigilant, focused and determined. Giving up is never an option. We fight til the end. "I want to thank all that came today to support me and my team, for travelling all this way. I am truly grateful and want to send you love and positive energy. "These past 5 races have been hard but I stay positive with the belief I have in my team that we will fight back. Onto the next one." Hamilton is now 32 points behind championship leader Max Verstappen.<br><br>

                    There were several misdemeanours in the Austrian GP - and notably five-second time penalties for Lando Norris and Sergio Perez (x2). Norris was adjudged to have forced Perez off at Turn 4, while Perez pulled off an identical move on Charles Leclerc before again running the Ferrari driver wide at Turn 6. FIA race director has explained the penalties. “Obviously the stewards had a look at all three,” said Masi. “In Sergio’s case with Lando, he was wholly alongside Lando and therefore there is an onus to leave a car’s width to the edge of the track. And then the same in the reverse with Checo [Perez] and Charles at the exit of Turn 4. “And then Checo and Charles again at the exit of Turn 6, [the stewards’] view was – and I don’t sit in the stewards’ room to deliberate – that in all three circumstances, a car’s width should have been left to the edge of the track because the two cars were alongside each other.”<br><br>
                    
                    Good news for Mercedes and certainly good new for F1 as a whole, with the sport's biggest star committing to continue racing for at least another two years amid his record-breaking career. Stefano Domenicali, F1's president and CEO, said in a statement: "This is fantastic news for Formula 1 and I am delighted that Lewis will stay In F1 for at least another two years. “What he has achieved in this sport is incredible and I know he has more to come. He is a global superstar on and off the race track and his positive impact on Formula 1 is huge.”

                <h1>Australian Grand Prix cancelled for second successive year due to coronavirus</h1>

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Formula 1's Australian Grand Prix has been cancelled for the second year in a row due to "restrictions and logistical challenges" related to the coronavirus pandemic, organisers have announced. The Grand Prix was due to be held at the Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit in Melbourne from November 18-21 after being moved from its usual date in March, due to a change in quarantine restrictions in the state of Victoria.<br><br>
                
                    However, on Tuesday organisers announced that the event had been cancelled for the second successive season, with the 2020 event also called off after a McLaren team member contracted coronavirus shortly before the race.<br><br>

                    "The Australian Grand Prix Corporation (AGPC) in conjunction with the Victorian Government and Formula 1 today announced the 2021 Formula 1 Australian Grand Prix has been cancelled due to restrictions and logistical challenges relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic," read a statement. "AGPC will continue to work with Formula 1 and the Victorian Government regarding the 2022 calendar timings for the Formula 1 Australian Grand Prix event." The Australian MotoGP, due to be held in Phillip Island from October 22-24, has also been cancelled, with the Malaysian event brought forward by a week to replace it in the calendar.<br><br>
                    
                    "We're deeply disappointed that for a second consecutive year, both MotoGP and Formula 1 fans won't be able to see the world's best riders and drivers compete at the wonderful Phillip Island and Albert Park Grand Prix Circuits," said AGPC chairman Paul Little. "We appreciate the challenge Australia faces with current international travel restrictions and the importance of vaccinations. "I would like to reassure our motivated and professional staff, suppliers and partners, as well as the Victorian tourism and major events community that we will work tirelessly to deliver these iconic events in 2022."<br><br>

                    Formula 1 chief executive Stefano Domenicali added: "While it is disappointing we won't be racing in Australia this season, we are confident we can deliver a 23 race season in 2021 and we have a number of options to take forward to replace the place left vacant by the Australian Grand Prix. "We will be working through the details of those options in the coming weeks and will provide further updates once those discussions are concluded."<br><br>

                    McLaren's Australian driver Daniel Ricciardo added: "It's a huge disappointment for all of the drivers that we won't be coming down to Australia in November, but we understand the reasons.
